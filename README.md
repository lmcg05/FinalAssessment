# IMS PROJECT

The main objective of this project is to create an application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all f
undamental modules which was covered during training.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites



```
> Java
> Eclipse
> Jenkins
> Maven
> Github
> Google CLoud Platform(GCP)
> MySQL
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Multiple tools were utilize including Java, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Jenkins and Github. Each softwares are downloaded through
different sources. The sources are listed below:
Eclipse - (https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/EclipseJava_HowTo.html)
Java - (https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/EclipseJava_HowTo.html)
GCP(Google cloud platform) - (https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/quickstart)
MySQL -(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/8.0/en/windows-install-archive.html
Maven -(https://howtodoinjava.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-on-windows/)
Git - (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Additional files such as JDK and JRE that needs to be installed. They are compilers and debuggers which are command-line development 
tools that are necessary or useful for developing applets and applications.

Maven is a build tool which is installed by performing a simple process of extracting the archive and adding the `bin` 
folder with the `mvn` command to the `PATH`.

Create VM instances through Google Cloud Platform(GCP) and obtain the IP address which would be used to set up MySQL database
Jenkins also uses VM instances to obtain IP address which would be use for the utilization of Jenkins.

Test appropriate connection ensuring that all plugins are added including mysql connecter,apache.maven,mockito,Junit. 

Ensuring that all JDBC drivers are installed which would allow the users to access the database.




```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests


### Unit Tests 

Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them

```
Unit Testing is one of the methods used to run the test. Unit testing helps to determine if the code is usable. 
Specific framework called Junit is used to perform unit testing. Junit tests the functionality of the code and it is significant 
because it is one of the earliest testing efforts performed on the code and the earlier defects are 
detected, the easier they are to fix. Early bug-detection is also the most cost-effective for a project, with code fixes becoming more 
expensive the later they're found in the lifecycle.
```

### Integration Tests 
Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them

```
Integration testing is a type of testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. 
Jacoco is an example of an integration testing which has two types such as tools that add statements to the Java source code and 
require its recompilation and tools that instrument the bytecode, either before or during execution.


```

### And coding style tests
